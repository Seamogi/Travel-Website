                Your access to and use of this website on which this document is found (the “Website”) and all Services (as defined in Section 2), is subject exclusively to these Terms of Service. The terms “you”, “your” and similar pronouns refer to the person using or accessing the Website or the Services. The terms “we”, “our” and similar pronouns refer to the independently contracted person or entity referered to in the header of this site (the “Company”). This is a legally binding agreement between you and Company; please read it carefully. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any features or services available at any time on the Website or the Services are subject to these Terms of Service. Accessing the Website or the Services in any manner, even by automated means, constitutes your use of said Website or the Services, respectively, and your agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not accept these Terms of Service you must immediately stop using the Website or the Services. You may not use the Website or the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Service. You further expressly agree and acknowledge all of the following provisions:
                We reserve the right to update or amend (collectively, “change”) these Terms of Service at any time and will revise the effective date when we do so. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Service regularly for any changes and to take note of the posted effective date of the Terms of Service. Your continued use of the Website or the Services, as the case may be, after the posted effective dates constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service as modified, provided however, that such modifications shall not apply to any disputes arising prior to the effective date of the changes. Accordingly, you hereby agree that your continued use of the Website constitutes your waiver to contest the enforceability of any such changes (whether for lack of notice or otherwise). Please do not use the Website if you disagree with the provisions of this paragraph 1.3. Otherwise, your continued use is to be deemed conclusive acceptance thereof.

                Each component of your travel (including but not limited to cruises, hotels, flights, excursions, tours, all-inclusives, travel insurance, and all other travel related services) may include its own Terms of Service of service or a contract of carriage (the “Partner Terms”). If Partner Terms apply, you will be shown a link to the Partner Terms prior to completing your booking. We make no representations or warranties as to the Partner Terms. You acknowledge and agree that you will review and agree to the Partner Terms prior to booking your travel through the Services.
                The Services are not for use by users under the age of 18. By registering for the Services, you represent to us that you are over the age of 18, and warrant that you shall not allow persons under the age of 18 to use or access the Services.</p>
